# DayPlanner
Welcome to my simple day planner! :heart_eyes_cat:
[My Day Planner](https://ashleywhaley.github.io/DayPlanner/)

## Languages
While JQuery was one of the main languages used for this interactive planner, I also used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to add current time and dates. 

CSS was used to make this site more stylish. 

HTML was the starting point to get this planner running. 

## Description 
When page is loaded, it will display a daily planner to create users schedule. The current date will be displayed at the top and planner will offer a textarea for each hour of a standard work day. User can enter notes, tasks or event for each hour after saving and refreshing the page all comments will persist because information is stored in local storage. Planner will also offer user color-coded textarea for past, present and future comments. 

## Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
